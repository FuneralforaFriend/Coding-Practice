Don't Believe me! My source codes run slow and have bad readability. <br>
I just want you to get some hints how to solve it.<br>
All the codes uploaded in this repo pass the test in Baekjoon website.<br>
However, don't just copy and paste them when logged in your account.<br>
I recommend you to write your own answers by yourself.<br>
It will help you a lot more!<br>
